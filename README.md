# Intruder_extention
A script automating PortSwigger lab.

The name of the lab is **Lab: Broken brute-force protection, IP block**.

The lab can be found here: https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based/lab-broken-bruteforce-protection-ip-block

There are 2 scripts where one is simple and the other is more advanced introducing **asynchronous** requests. In the context of this specific lab it doesn't make that much of a differnce because of the small amount of passwords to try.
